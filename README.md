### ⏭️ Next Step: Completing the Merge

After pasting the code and saving the file, you must tell Git the conflict is resolved:

1.  **Stage the file:**
    ```bash
    git add README.md
    ```

2.  **Commit the merge** (if you've staged all other 5 files as well):
    ```bash
    git commit -m "merge: Resolve conflicts between main and conflict-simulator branches. Integrated all experimental features safely behind flags/comments."
    ```

3.  **Push the result:**
    ```bash
    git push origin main
    ```

Let me know if you need any help with the final `git commit` or the next phase of your challenge!
